# Grawth Curve Models / Growth Mixture Models

## These are examples of Growth Curve Model and Growth Mixture Model in R.

There are two different data sets: one for the GCM analysis (assessing science aptitude growth throughout high school), and one for the GMM analysis (assessing improvement in depression in adults).

### Growth Curve Model data set

This data set contains obsservations for 3000 high school students. Science aptitude was assessed among high school students each year throughout the four years of high schools.

### Growth Mixture Model data set

This data set contains observations for 8500 adults being treated for depression over the course of five time-points. Each participant is rated on improvement in depression symptoms (higher scores mean more improvement and therefore decreased depression levels).
